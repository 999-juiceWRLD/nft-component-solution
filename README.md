## Frontend Mentor NFT Component Solution

- This is my solution to the NFT Component challenge.

- Since I'm a newbie on frontend apps, it took 2 days for me to finish it. I'm learning `@media` stuff to provide convenience for mobile & tablet users.

- I used [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/) for this challenge.
